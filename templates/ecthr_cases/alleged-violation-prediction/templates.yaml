      These facts show potential violation of EHCR articles could have been violated.
      The quantity of violated articles is

      In ruling on this case I have needed to carefully consider the submissions of
      the parties. The plaintiffs allege breaches of the EHCR - the number of sections
      allegedly breached is

      {{{1:"one",2:"two",3:"three",4:"more than three"}[[4,labels | length] | min]}}.'

      Question: Is it true that the facts in this case indicate {{{1:"one",2:"two",3:"three",4:"more
      than three"}[[4,labels | length] | min]}} sections of the EHCR were allegedly
      violated? Answer "yes" or "no"
